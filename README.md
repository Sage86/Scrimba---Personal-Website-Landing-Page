# Scrimba---Personal-Website-Landing-Page

PERSONAL WEBSITE LANDING PAGE

In early June 2023, I started the Frontend Developer Career Path with Scrimba. I had been working through Module 2: Web Dev Basics, in a chapter entitled, "Build & deploy your first website".
As well as being introduced to some more basic elements within HTML, CSS (and a teensy introduction to JavaScript), the chapter culminated in learning to build a simple personal website landing page.

The end result was uploaded to Netlify (a programme I'd not heard of, but like the way it looks and work so far).
However, I did choose to rebuild the page within VS Code as it's an IDE I'm familiar with.


It is super early days yet, but I'm not gonna lie, I'm very apprehensive about getting to the JavaScript stage...

However, I'm going to remain consistent throughout the duration of this course and beyond ^^
